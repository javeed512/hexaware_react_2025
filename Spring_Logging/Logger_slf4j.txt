As a software developer, do you spend most of your time debugging your code? Going through the entire codebase and still not able to figure out where your code went awry? Here’s where logging comes to the rescue!

Logging is the process of tracking all the events that happen after a piece of code is run. It is a very important aspect of software development as it helps to track where exactly the code crashes and thus eases debugging .

Let’s understand how logging is done in spring boot!

To make logging easier for programmers, Java provides a variety of logging frameworks like : log4J, java.util.logging (JUL), tiny log, logback, etc.

A logging framework can be used to perform all the tasks like setting log file destinations, customizing log messages , etc.

Spring Boot comes with SLF4J inbuilt, which is an abstraction of all these logging frameworks. SLF4J stands for Simple Logging Façade for Java. It allows users to work with any of the logging frameworks with a single dependency.

Every logging framework comes with three elements.

Logger — capture the messages
Formatter — formats the messages captured by the logger
Handler — Dispatches the messages by printing them on the console , or storing them in a file , sending an email, etc.
Let’s go step by step to understand each of these elements.

LOGGER
To generate loggers , we use the LoggerFactory class of the org.slf4j and the Logger interface is the entry point to slf4j API. The getLogger is a method of LoggerFactory class that takes a string value as a name and provides the logger object of the specified name .

Logger logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(Controller.class);

What are log levels:
The messages logged can be of various security levels . Spring Boot supports five log levels which are

ERROR — runtime errors
DEBUG — Information about the flow of the system
TRACE — more detailed information about the flow of the system
WARNING — warning for the errors caused due to the usage of deprecated APIs.
INFO — events occurring at the run time







Logging pattern controller can be done by developers using following properties in application.properties file.




logging.level.root = ALL

logging.level.com.hexaware.restapi.service= OFF

# for console 
#logging.pattern.console=%clr(%d{yyyy-MM-dd}){red} %clr([%level]) %m %n


# file auto generated with below name extension should be ".log"  --> refresh project to see file updates
logging.file.name = product_log_file.log

#for file pattern
logging.pattern.file= %clr(%d{yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss.SSS}){green} [%level] %c{1.} [%t] %m%n










-----------------------

	logger.info("this is info message")

	logger.debug("this is debug msg")

	logger.trace("this is trace msg")

	logger.warn("this is warning")







====================================

In Log4j, "patterns" primarily refer to conversion patterns used within a PatternLayout to define the format of log messages. These patterns dictate how various pieces of information related to a logging event, such as timestamp, log level, logger name, thread name, and the actual message, are arranged in the final log output.
Each pattern consists of a combination of literal text and conversion characters (also known as conversion specifiers), which are preceded by a percent sign (%). Each conversion character represents a specific piece of information.
Here are some common Log4j pattern conversion characters and their meanings:
%d: Outputs the date and time of the logging event. Can be followed by a date format pattern in curly braces (e.g., %d{yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss}).
%p: Outputs the log level (e.g., INFO, DEBUG, ERROR). Can be followed by a number for padding (e.g., %-5p for left-justified, 5-character width).
%c: Outputs the name of the logger that issued the logging request. Can be followed by a precision specifier (e.g., %c{1} to show only the rightmost component). 
%t: Outputs the name of the thread that generated the logging event. 
%m: Outputs the actual log message.
%n: Adds a platform-specific new line character.
%L: Outputs the line number where the logging event occurred (can impact performance).
%C: Outputs the fully qualified class name of the caller (can impact performance).
Example:
A common Log4j pattern is "%d [%t] %-5p %c - %m%n". This pattern would result in log entries formatted as:

2025-08-06 10:00:00,123 [main] INFO  com.example.MyClass - This is a log message.
