Differences between Controlled and Uncontrolled Components:
Controlled Components                     	         Uncontrolled Components
React manages the state of form elements.	         DOM manages the state using useRef hook.
Uses onChange event handler for state updates.	         No specific event handlers; DOM directly handles changes.
State updates reset form elements easily.	         Resetting form values is more complex.
Preferred when using React for state management.	 Used when not using React or when direct DOM control is preferred.
