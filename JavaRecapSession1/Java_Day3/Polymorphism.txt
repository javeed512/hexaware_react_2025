Polymorphism :
Any thing which posses multile behaviors or act different at different places known as polymorphism.

Ex: Person --> Customer , Student , Son , Friend 


1. Compile Time / Static Polymorphism
 Overloading is the example of Compiletime polymorphism
Ex: Method Overloading , Constructor Overloading , Operator Overloading

Ex: Operator Overloading
"hello"+"world"  ---> helloworld
 2+3  ---> 5


2. Runtime / Dynamic Polymorphism
   Method  Overriding is the example of Runtime Polymorphism
 Note: Runtime polymorphism takes place only when inheritance exists between two classes.
Ex:  i. Method overriding ii. Parent class reference variable holding child class object

Runtime Polymorphism
Person  p =  new Person();
 	  =  new  Dancer();
	 =  new Programmer();
	 =  new Driver();



public > protect > default > private

class Person{


protected Person  get(int x,String y){

	// logic

}


}


class Programmer extends Person{


public Programmer get(int x,String y){

	// different logic

}

	

}
