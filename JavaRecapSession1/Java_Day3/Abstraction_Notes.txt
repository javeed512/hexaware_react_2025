Abstraction:

Highlighting set of services to the user and hiding implementation code.

Abstraction can be achieved using interfaces and abstract class/concrete class


Interface:
===========
User View: 
Interface act as a medium to access set of service provided by the service provider  to the end user 


Developer View:
 Interface is nothing but  requirement or specification which needs to implement by the developers  (set of service given in interface will be implmented by the developer)


InterfaceType  i = new ImplementationClass();


Tips:

1. Parent class ref variable holds child class object

 BankImp1  b =   new BankImp2();  // runtime polymorphism

2. Interface ref variable  can hold its implementation class object

  IBank  b = new BankImp2();  // abstraction
